Making use of an IaaS platform, it would be hosted over Amazon Web Services EC2.
This website would allow users to:
- Select muscle groups they would want to train
- Select number of sets and repetitions for each exercise
- Plan and organize these workouts across different days of the week
The project itself demonstrates actual server deployment, front-end design, and documentation skills.
